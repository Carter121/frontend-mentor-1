## My process

I started by separating the different elements into groups using <div> tags. I then assigned them each an ID or a class. I styled them and spent way to long trying to make it centered.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how using a CSS Grid can make life easier. And how to properly center a div.

I am happy I got the box shadow working on the 'Proceed to Payment' button.

```css
#pay {
  border: 1px transparent solid;
  background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 10px 0 10px 0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font-weight: 700;
  width: 300px;
  margin-top: 30px;
  box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px 3px rgba(56, 41, 224, 0.3);
}
```
